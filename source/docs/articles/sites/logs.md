Log files track and record your site's activity to help you find, debug, and isolate current or potential problems on your site. These logs can also be used to compile statistics about your visitors and referral traffic.

Each environment (Multidev, Dev, Test, and Live) has their own respective log files, which can be obtained via SFTP.

## Download Raw Webserver Log Files
1. Access the Site Dashboard and desired environment (Multidev, Dev, Test, or Live).
2. Click **Connection Info** and copy the **SFTP Command Line** command.
3. Open a terminal window and paste in the SFTP connection command.
4. Run the following SFTP command in terminal:

   ```nohighlight
   get -r logs
   ```

You now have a local copy of the logs directory, which contains the following:
```nohighlight
├── logs
    └──newrelic.log
    └──nginx-access.log
    └──nginx-error.log
    └──php-error.log
    └──php-fpm-error.log
    └──php-slow.log
    └──pyinotify.log
    └──watcher.err
    └──watcher.log
```
You can automate this process with the following script:
```
# Replace SITE_UUID with value from Dashboard URL
SITE_UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
for app_server in `dig +short appserver.live.$SITE_UUID.drush.in`;
do
mkdir $app_server
sftp -o Port=2222 live.$SITE_UUID@$app_server << !
  cd logs
  lcd $app_server
  mget *.log
!
done
```

## Download MySQL Slow Query Log

1. Access the Site Dashboard and desired environment (Multidev, Dev, Test, or Live).
2. Click **Connection Info** and copy the **SFTP Command Line** command.
3. Edit and execute the command by replacing `appserver` with `dbserver`:

 ```nohighlight
 sftp -o Port=2222 dev.de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014@dbserver.dev.de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014.drush.in
 ```

4. Run the following SFTP command in terminal:
```nohighlight
get logs/mysqld-slow-query.log
```
You now have a local copy of the `mysqld-slow-query.log` file.
